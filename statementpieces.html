<h3>Consider Your Style</h3>
  <p>
    What kind of décor do you like? What kind of statement do you want to make with your statement pieces? When choosing statement pieces, it is important to consider your overall style. If you have a traditional décor, you might want to choose statement pieces that are classic and timeless. If you have a more modern décor, you might want to choose statement pieces that are bold and contemporary.
  </p>
<h3>Choose Pieces that are Well-Made</h3>
  <p>
    Statement pieces should be made of high-quality materials and construction.This will ensure that they will last for many years to come.

  </p>

<h3>Pay Attention to the Colors</h3>
