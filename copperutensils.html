<h2>History of copper utensils</h2>
<p>Copper utensils have been used for centuries, dating back to ancient Egypt. They were prized for their beauty, durability, and ability to conduct heat evenly. In the Middle Ages, copper cookware became increasingly popular, and it was used by both wealthy and poor families. In the 19th century, copper cookware began to be replaced by aluminium and stainless steel, as these materials were less expensive and easier to care for. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence in the popularity of copper cookware, as people have become more interested in using natural materials in their kitchens.</p>
